PHP app to keep track of inventory in my beer fridge.

"supports" a USB barcode scanner to add/remove inventory.

If untappd ever approves me, I'll probably integrate with that.

Not the greatest example of secure code, but if you're on my network I don't really care...

Definitely don't expose this to the internet!
